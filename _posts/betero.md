## Introduction

Betero is the world’s first people oriented betting platform that accepts deposits of multiple cryptocurrencies backed by a DAO. The Betero protocol will function as a hybrid decentralized model that enables the platform to function in a manner as simple as that of traditional betting companies. To build the Betero platform, blockchain technology and smart contracts will be used for the most part, provided it ensures simplicity for the user.

## Features

1. Access to all bet types: Place accumulator bets, European Handicap bets, and more without worrying about a lack of liquidity.
2. Full profit redistribution: All of our profit goes back directly to BTE token holders and players.
3. Cashback on lost bets: As part of the profit redistribution, you get cashback whenever you lose a bet.
4. High odds and no fees: We choose our odds provider by community voting and don’t charge anything on your bets.
5. A wide range of cryptocurrencies: We’re the world’s first online bookmaker that accepts deposits of multiple cryptocurrencies.
6. NFT-based soccer manager: Beat your friends and increase the value of your team.


## Vision

Betero’s vision is to build a next-generation sports betting platform based on the following core principles:
1. Transparent product metrics, profit redistribution, and smart contracts.
2. Utilization of blockchain and web3 technology.
3. Ability to run as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)
